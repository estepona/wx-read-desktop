Wechat Read Desktop is a minimal Wechat Read desktop client based on electron.js. All it does is wrapping the Wechat Read Web app in a simple desktop app, providing the same experience as Wechat Read Web app, which is good for quickly open this app when you have multiple browser tabs opened.

## Install

Installers can be found at [Release Page](https://github.com/estepona/wx-read-desktop/releases). Currently supporting Mac and Windows.

## Credit

Thanks to the Wechat Read Team for building such a great product. As a reader, I enjoyed the reading experience a lot on Mobile, Kindle, and Web. And as a developer, my goal is to give readers an opportunity to enjoy it on a desktop client. Since its web client is great enough for me, all I need to do is wrapping it with electron.
